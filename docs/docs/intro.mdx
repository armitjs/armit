import { Button } from '../src/components/button';

# Getting Started

### Install

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install mui-color-input
```

We have completed installing the package.

## Simple usage

<Button />

Here is a simple usage for using the component:

```jsx import React from 'react'; import {MuiColorInput} from 'mui-color-input';
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState('#ffffff');
  // highlight-next-line
  const handleChange = (color) => {
    setColor(color);
  };

  return <MuiColorInput value={color} onChange={handleChange} />;
};
```

:::info Note

While the high level concepts are the same, there are large implementation differences between the offered React, Angular and Vue renderer sets.
This tutorial describes how to add custom renderers for React-based renderer sets.
