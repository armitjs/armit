# @armit/babel-merge

babel-merge merges multiple Babel configuration objects into a single copy. Plugin and preset objects and arrays will be merged together.

## Note

options to plugins and presets will not be merged, but instead replaced by the last matching item's options. This makes the behavior consistent with how Babel works.
