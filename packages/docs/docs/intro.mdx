# Getting Started

## Install

```bash
npm install mui-color-input --save
```

or you can use **yarn**

```bash
yarn add mui-color-input
```

We have completed installing the package.

## Simple usage

Here is a simple usage for using the component:

```jsx import React from 'react'; import {MuiColorInput} from 'mui-color-input';
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState('#ffffff');

  const handleChange = (color) => {
    setColor(color);
  };

  return <MuiColorInput value={color} onChange={handleChange} />;
};
```

:::info Note

While the high level concepts are the same, there are large implementation differences between the offered React, Angular and Vue renderer sets.
This tutorial describes how to add custom renderers for React-based renderer sets.
